        <h2>Why you'll want to make <em>Reibekuchen</em></h2>
            <p>There just isn't anything better than coming home from a walk on a rainy afternoon and warming yourself up with a couple of freshly baked <em>Reibekuchen</em>.
            The english translation <em>potato pancake</em> sounds like somethings children would cook, if they were allowed to mix anything together.
            So I'm sticking with Reibekuchen throughout this recipe.</p>
        <h2>The Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5kg potatoes</li>
            <li>3 onions</li>
            <li>~200g 405 wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Topping of your choice:
                <ul>
                    <li>Molasses</li>
                    <li>Sour cream and chives</li>
                    <li>Apple sauce</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the <mark>potatoes</mark> and remove anything, that doesn't look edible. Like sprouts, green marks, ingrown soil etc.</li>
            <li>Coarsely grate potatoes, chop and add the <mark>onions</mark> to the grated potatoes.</li>
            <li>Add a lot of <mark>salt</mark>> (trust me, it's 1.5kg of potatoes. They need it) and a bit of <mark>pepper</mark>.</li>
            <li>Crack in the 2 <mark>pepper</mark> and mix everything together.</li>
            <li>Now add the <mark>flour</mark> bit by bit.
                I recommend starting with 4 tbs, mixing everything together.
                If you feel, that the mass needs more flour, you can add more right away or you fry the first portion and then see if the <em>Reibekuchen</em> need more flour.</li>
            <li>Heat your pan to medium-high and add <mark>4-5 tbs oil</mark>.</li>
            <li>As soon as the oil starts shimmering in your frying pan, add a generous tbs of your potato-mixture to the pan (<strong>Caution! Hot oil!</strong>), making one portion.
                You'll want to have 3 - 4 portions at all times in your frying pan, almost swimming in oil.
                Flip the Reibekuchen after 3 - 4 minutes.
                Remember to add more oil, if they start to smoke too much.
                As soon as they are golden brown on both sides, put them down on a plate with a paper towel on it.
                Cover with another layer of paper towel and set aside.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until done.</li>
            <li>Put a couple of perfectly cooked Reibekuchen on your plate and add them with the <mark>topping</mark> of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
