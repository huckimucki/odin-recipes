        <h2>Why you'll want to make <em>Reibekuchen</em></h2>
            <p>There just isn't anything better than coming home from a walk on a rainy afternoon and warming yourself up with a couple of <em>Reibekuchen</em>.
            The english translation <em>potato pancake</em> sounds like somethings children would cook, if they were allowed to mix anything together.
            So I'm sticking with Reibekuchen throughout this recipe.</p>
