        <h2>Why you'll want to make this Sandwich</h2>
            <p>This is one of the best, if not <strong>the best</strong> sandwich I have ever tasted. Actually, I have never been to NOLA and never had the chance to taste the original creation. But this recipe alone, that I've just made up from the picture shown above, is <strong>a gift from god</strong>. The chips make it crunchy, the cheese makes it creamy and holds the mortadella in place (well sort of), the mortadella itself gives this sandwich flavour you haven't tasted anywhere else, the shredded lettuce (shredduce or shrettuce) gives it well deserved freshness and the combination of mustard and mayonnaise compliment each other better than any other sauce. If that description alone doesn't make you hungry, than I don't know what will.</p>
        <h2>The Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>This makes one tasty sandwich</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bread of your choice
                <ul>
                    <li>toast</li>

                    <li>white bread</li>
                    <li>sourdough bread</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp medium mustard (like LÃ¶wensenf)</li>
            <li>1 tsp Hellmann's mayonnaise or nothing</li>
            <li>1 head of lettuce</li>
            <li>150g mortadella</li>
            <li>1 slice sandwich cheese</li>
            <li>1 handful salted potato chips</li>
            <li>1 tbs vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>I recommend <strong>reading the whole recipe before starting</strong>, so you don't mix up steps
            <ol>
            <li>Wash the <mark>lettuce</mark> and cut it into small, bite-friendly stripes</li>
            <li>Add the <mark>oil</mark> to your cold skillet and set it to medium-high.
                Put the <mark>mortadella</mark> slices in the skillet, that they lay a bit on each other, but don't build yourself a mortadella-tower.
                When the edges start to bubble, flip the whole mortadella-layer around.
                Add the <mark>cheese</mark> on top, put in a small shot of water and top the skillet with the lid.
                Let sit for 1 minute.
                When the cheese has melted, let your mortadella-cheese-creation slide on the shrettuce</li>
            <li>Take out another pan and add your tbs <mark>butter</mark>.
                Set the pan to high heat and as soon as the butter has melted, add you two slices of <mark>bread</mark>.
                Let them sit for 30 seconds, flip, and let sit for another 30 seconds.
                If you see smoke rising, they're already done earlier and ready to meet our next two frie... I mean Ingredients.</li>
            <li>Spread a tsp <mark>mustard</mark> on one slice and a tsp <mark>mayonnaise</mark> on the other.</li>
            <li>Assemble the sandwich as follows:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Bread with mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>Shrettuce</li>
                    <li>Mortadella-cheese-creation</li>
                    <li>Handful potato chips</li>
                    <li>Bread with mustard</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Enjoy this beautiful creation with an ice cold can of Root Beer, Cream Soda or any other soda.
            The main thing is the can.
            Or maybe it's just my personal preference.</p>
