    <h2>Why you'll want to make Chicken Parm</h2>
    <p>I love chicken parm.
        I would say that I have loved it my whole life but that would be a lie, because I just discovered it.
        <em>Just</em> meaning two years ago. But since than I had an unhealthy amount of burnt tongues and scratched palates.
        But I never look back.
        Because this dish is absolutely worth it.
        Even on the next day.
        Doesn't even matter if it's cold and directly out of the fridge or carefully reheated in a fresh tablespoon of italian olive oil.
        </p>
        <p>Chicken Parm is your friend.</p>
        <p>Chicken Parm cares.</p>
        <p>Chicken Parm understands.</p>
        <p>Chicken Parm will always be there for you.</p>
